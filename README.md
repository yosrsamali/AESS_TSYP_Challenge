## *2. Problem Statement*  
Modern agriculture is plagued by critical issues such as nutrient-depleted soils, unpredictable flooding, and inefficient planting practices. Traditional methods of monitoring and management fail to provide real-time, actionable insights, leaving farmers vulnerable to crop losses and resource wastage. For instance, waterlogged fields can ruin crops, while weed infestations significantly impact yields. Addressing these problems requires an integrated solution that utilizes advanced technology to monitor soil health, predict environmental risks, and guide resource management effectively.
